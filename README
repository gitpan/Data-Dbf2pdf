 Dbf2pdf 0.7  10-16-2001
 
 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

 The Dbf2pdf module is used to create a PDF document from the contents of
 a DBF file.  It uses several options to create the PDF document to the 
 user's specifications such as font, paper size, page orientation, etc.    

 PREREQUISITES
 -------------
  
 Before installation you will need a few things.  This module uses a wrapper 
 along with Text::PDF::API.  The PDF module can be acquired at CPAN.  The 
 XBase module is used to acquire the DBF info to hand to the PDF module.  
 It can also be found at CPAN.  It is highly recommended that you use the 
 most recent versions of the modules below.    
   
 Current versions:

   Text-PDF-API-0.701.4  http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Text-PDF-API
   DBD-XBase-0.200       http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=DBD-XBase  
   
 INSTALL
 ------- 
 
 Standard perl module installation.  Before you do a "make Makefile.PL", you 
 may want to specify what directory in which the module does some of it's work 
 (See below).  It will default to the system's "/tmp" directory otherwise. 
 A simple build: 

 	perl Makefile.PL
        make  
        make install
 
 Then a 'make realclean' is recommended to clean up.
  
 To specify a different directory than "/tmp" in which the module does
 some work when called:

        perl Makefile.PL --TEMP_DIR=/somedir 
 
 TODO
 ----
 
 Some things to expect in a future release:

   1. Font type can be selected instead of being static (Courier).
      - Courier is fixed width font which is much easier to handle when the 
        size changes and lines are being drawn and so forth.   
  
   2. On the last page stop drawing lines when the data stops.  Currently
      all lines are drawn on each page.
